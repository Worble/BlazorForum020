# Post previews lean to the right which disappear on mobile, and also should be larger.
# Implement SignalR whenever blazor support is ready
# Change Get/PostJsonAsync to SendAsync so we can access proper Http codes and display relevant error messages to the user
# Implement an admin area for reports
# Sidemenu can drop off the bottom of the screen and become inaccessible
# Image saving code should probably be refactored to be less of a mess
# Change the current generic DTOs into view specific ones so less fields with simply 'null' in them are being thrown about
# Reconsider architecture; imageservice for saving images should probably be controlled by postservice rather than the postcontroller so we can properly rollback changes if something goes wrong
